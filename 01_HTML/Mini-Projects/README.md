## Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser to view these projects:
* Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, or any other modern browser

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/html-form-projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```sh
   cd html-form-projects
   ```
3. Open any of the HTML files in your web browser:
   - `HTMLRegistrationForm.html` - Basic registration form
   - `StudentForm.html` - Student registration form
   - `What&How_HTML.html` - HTML tutorial page

Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file from GitHub and extract it to your preferred location.

## Usage

These projects can be used as:
- Learning resources for HTML beginners
- Starting templates for your own projects
- Teaching materials for HTML form concepts
- References for various form elements and attributes

### How to Run

1. Simply open the HTML files in any web browser
2. For the form projects, fill in the fields to see how they function
3. For the HTML reference guide, interact with the different elements to understand their behavior
   
**Note:** The forms will not submit data to a real server. The `action` attributes in the forms point to non-existent PHP files (`action.php`, `server.php`). This is for demonstration purposes only.
